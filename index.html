								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/row.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Hi, I’m a recent graduate of University of California, San Diego (UCSD) with a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in Cognitive Science with a Specialization in Design and Interaction. Along with that I also have two Associate of Arts (A.A.) degrees at De Anza College in Business Administration and Liberal Arts-Business and CIS Emphasis. I am currently located in San Jose, CA.</p>
								<p>When I have free time, I spend my time playing tennis, though I’m not that good. I consider myself to be a 3.0 player that primarily plays baseline. I also practice a Vietnamese Martial Arts called Vovinam, at which I’ve been practicing for more than 15 years, and my current level is a yellow belt two stripes, good enough for me to be an instructor. I enjoy a good beer, especially crafted beer, so if I have the time I like to venture out to breweries and try out new beer. Personally my favorite types of beers are IPAs. I’m thinking about trying to brew my own beer someday just for fun. </p>

								<h3 class="major">Spotify Top Song (Data Science Project)</h3>
								<p>This is a data science group project for the class COGS 108, which was to use various data science skills learned in class to gather data and conduct a research project. The question our group decided to target was “What factors makes a song popular?” We decided to use Spotify top 50 charts and gathered data using Spotify api and <a href="http://kworb.net/spotify/country/global_daily_totals.html">kworb.net</a>, which is a site that aggregates Spotify Data and create a chart from the data. Factors that we decided on could range from tone, amplitude, notes, and even artist. After gathering data we created various charts to show our findings.
